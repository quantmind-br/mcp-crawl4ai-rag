# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the `mcp-crawl4ai-rag` application to improve its modular structure. The refactoring aims to decompose monolithic components like `crawl4ai_mcp.py` and `utils.py` into smaller, cohesive modules with well-defined responsibilities, following Clean Architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Improve Code Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to have clear separation of concerns and reduced coupling, so that I can easily fix bugs and modify existing functionality without affecting unrelated components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. WHEN modifying a specific feature THEN changes SHALL be isolated to relevant modules only
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN circular dependencies SHALL NOT exist between modules
4. WHEN reviewing code structure THEN the Single Responsibility Principle SHALL be followed throughout

### Requirement 2: Enhance Code Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear architectural structure, so that I can easily add new tools and services without modifying existing core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new MCP tools THEN they SHALL be added to appropriate tool modules without modifying core application logic
2. WHEN integrating new external services THEN they SHALL be added as new client modules following established patterns
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the layered architecture SHALL support extension without modification of existing layers
4. WHEN reviewing the architecture THEN the Dependency Rule SHALL be enforced (dependencies point inward)

### Requirement 3: Establish Clear Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive project structure, so that I can quickly locate and understand the responsibility of each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the codebase THEN the directory structure SHALL clearly reflect the layered architecture
2. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN related code SHALL be grouped in cohesive modules
3. WHEN examining imports THEN module dependencies SHALL follow the established layer hierarchy
4. WHEN reviewing file organization THEN each layer SHALL contain only code appropriate to its responsibility level

### Requirement 4: Maintain Functional Integrity

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want all existing functionality to work exactly as before, so that the refactoring doesn't break any current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass with 100% success rate
2. WHEN using MCP tools THEN their interfaces and behavior SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all services SHALL initialize correctly
4. WHEN performing any existing operation THEN the results SHALL be identical to pre-refactoring behavior

### Requirement 5: Eliminate Code Smells

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove problematic code patterns, so that the codebase follows best practices and is easier to work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining `src/utils.py` THEN it SHALL be decomposed into focused, single-responsibility modules
2. WHEN reviewing the utils structure THEN the confusing coexistence of `src/utils.py` and `src/utils/` directory SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN analyzing `src/crawl4ai_mcp.py` THEN its multiple responsibilities SHALL be separated into appropriate layers
4. WHEN checking for large classes/files THEN no single module SHALL exceed reasonable size limits for its responsibility

### Requirement 6: Implement Layered Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow Clean Architecture principles, so that the codebase has clear boundaries and proper dependency flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL have distinct layers: tools, services, clients, core, and features
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN tools SHALL depend on services, services SHALL depend on clients, and core SHALL be independent
3. WHEN reviewing module organization THEN each layer SHALL contain only code appropriate to its abstraction level
4. WHEN tracing data flow THEN the architecture SHALL support the dependency inversion principle

### Requirement 7: Preserve Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development and testing workflow to remain unchanged, so that existing scripts and processes continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `uv run pytest` THEN the command SHALL execute successfully with all tests passing
2. WHEN using existing scripts in the `scripts/` directory THEN they SHALL work without modification or be updated appropriately
3. WHEN starting the application THEN the entry points SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN performing static analysis THEN `ruff` and `mypy` checks SHALL pass without errors

### Requirement 8: Support Incremental Migration

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the refactoring, I want to perform the migration in safe, incremental steps, so that I can validate each change and minimize risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing each refactoring phase THEN the test suite SHALL pass before proceeding to the next phase
2. WHEN moving code between modules THEN imports SHALL be updated systematically to prevent broken references
3. WHEN restructuring components THEN each step SHALL be independently verifiable
4. WHEN encountering issues THEN the incremental approach SHALL allow for easy rollback of specific changes
