## Key Features
- **Web Crawling**: Intelligent web content extraction with Crawl4AI
- **GitHub Integration**: Clone and index GitHub repositories with documentation
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search using Qdrant vector database
- **Knowledge Graph**: Code structure analysis and AI hallucination detection with Neo4j
- **RAG Capabilities**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation with multiple strategies
- **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol support for AI agents

## Target Users
- AI agents and coding assistants
- Developers needing advanced web crawling and content indexing
- Teams building RAG systems with knowledge graphs
- Applications requiring AI hallucination detection for code

## Development Status
Active development project, being developed for integration with Archon framework.
