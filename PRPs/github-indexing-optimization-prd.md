# GitHub Repository Indexing Optimization - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines optimization strategies for the `index_github_repository` MCP tool to achieve 50-70% performance improvements in processing GitHub repositories for RAG and Knowledge Graph indexing. The current implementation processes ~27.5 seconds per file, which can be optimized through parallel processing, intelligent batching, and resource management improvements.

## Problem Statement

### Current Performance Issues

- **Sequential File Processing**: Files are processed in small batches (5 concurrent files) with significant I/O wait times
- **Suboptimal Resource Utilization**: CPU cores and memory are underutilized during processing
- **Tree-sitter Parser Overhead**: AST parsing happens individually per file without caching optimizations
- **Network Latency**: Multiple individual database calls instead of efficient batch operations
- **Memory Management**: No intelligent chunking strategy for large files

### Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Reduce average processing time per file from 27.5s to 10-15s (45-55% improvement)
- **Secondary**: Increase concurrent file processing from 5 to 15-20 files
- **Tertiary**: Reduce memory footprint by 30% through intelligent chunking
- **Quality**: Maintain 100% accuracy and data consistency across optimizations

## Market & Technical Research

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on research findings:
- **Tree-sitter Performance**: AST parsing can achieve linear time complexity with proper caching
- **Async Processing**: Python asyncio can handle 50-100 concurrent operations efficiently
- **Batch Processing**: Database batch operations show 5-10x performance improvements
- **Parallel AST Parsing**: Multiple parser instances can process files concurrently safely

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Intelligent Batching**: Process similar file types together for parser optimization
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections and prepared statements
3. **Memory Streaming**: Process large files in chunks without loading entirely in memory
4. **Cache Optimization**: Share parsed AST components between similar files
